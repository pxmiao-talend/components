 * {@code Serializable}. This allows the {@code SourceOrSink} instance created in this "main program" to be sent (in
 * serialized form) to remote worker machines and reconstituted for each batch of elements being processed. A
 * {@code SourceOrSink} can have instance variable state, and non-transient instance variable state will be serialized

 * {@code SourceOrSink} implementations MUST be effectively immutable. The only acceptable use of mutable fields is to
 * cache the results of expensive operations, and such fields MUST be marked {@code transient}.
 *
 * <p>
 * {@code SourceOrSink} implementations should override {@link Object#toString}, as it will be used in important error
 * and debugging messages.
